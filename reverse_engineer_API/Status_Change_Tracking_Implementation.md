# Metrics Tracking System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive metrics tracking system for OSP job processing. The system will track job statuses, pole metrics, user productivity, and enable advanced analytics for resource planning and burndown tracking.

## Current State

### Existing Implementation
- Daily script running in Google Cloud Run that pulls all jobs and their statuses twice daily
- Updates are stored in SharePoint tracker
- Weekly report generation script (`weekly_reporter.py`) currently being tested
- Testing revealed issues with status tracking and field completion metrics

### Integration Goals
- Maintain existing Cloud Run job functionality
- Enhance data collection with detailed metrics
- Enable historical tracking and trending
- Provide resource optimization capabilities

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
1. Database Schema Created
   - Users table for role management
   - Job metrics for progress tracking
   - Status changes for history
   - Pole metrics for detailed tracking
   - User metrics for productivity
   - Daily summaries for reporting
   - Burndown metrics for planning
   - Resource recommendations for optimization

2. Local Development Environment Setup (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
   - PostgreSQL installed and configured
   - Database connection utilities implemented
   - Schema deployment tested
   - Basic CRUD operations verified

### Phase 2: Integration Strategy (üîÑ IN PROGRESS)

#### Local Development
1. Database Integration
   - Parallel tracking with existing system
   - Data validation and verification
   - Performance testing
   - Error handling implementation

2. Script Modifications
   - Add database logging to existing functions
   - Maintain current functionality
   - Implement rollback capabilities
   - Add error handling and logging

#### Docker Implementation
1. Container Configuration
   ```dockerfile
   # TODO: Update Dockerfile to include:
   - PostgreSQL service
   - Volume mounts for persistence
   - Environment variable handling
   - Health checks
   ```

2. Docker Compose Updates
   ```yaml
   # TODO: Add to docker-compose.yml:
   - Database service
   - Network configuration
   - Volume management
   - Environment handling
   ```

#### Cloud Run Migration
1. Cloud SQL Integration
   - Setup Cloud SQL instance
   - Configure secure connections
   - Implement failover strategy
   - Setup backup procedures

2. Deployment Strategy

   C --> D[Production Validation]
   ```

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation (‚è≥ PENDING)
1. Historical Tracking
   - Status change logging
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Trend analysis capabilities

2. Analytics Enhancement
   - Burndown calculations
   - Resource optimization
   - Performance analytics
   - Predictive modeling

## Deployment Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Run database locally
# PostgreSQL running on localhost:5432

# 2. Environment setup
DB_NAME=metrics_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASS=metrics_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# 3. Test execution
python3 database/init_db.py  # Initialize database
python3 main.py  # Run main application
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# TODO: Docker configuration
docker-compose up --build

# Testing
docker-compose run app python -m pytest
```

### Cloud Run Deployment
```bash
# TODO: Cloud deployment
gcloud run deploy metrics-service \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Modify existing scripts to include database logging
   - Add database operations alongside current functionality
   - Implement validation checks
   - Add error handling
   - Setup monitoring

2. Update Docker configuration
   - Add PostgreSQL service
   - Configure networking
   - Setup volumes
   - Update environment handling

3. Prepare Cloud SQL migration
   - Setup Cloud SQL instance
   - Configure security
   - Plan data migration
   - Test connectivity

### Future Enhancements
1. Advanced Analytics
   - Custom reporting
   - Real-time dashboards
   - Predictive analytics
   - Resource optimization

2. Automation
   - Automated resource allocation
   - Schedule optimization
   - Priority management
   - Alert system
